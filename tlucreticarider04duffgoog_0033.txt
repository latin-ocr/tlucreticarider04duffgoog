ANALYSIS.

The fifth book of Lucretius is a kind of philosophical epic
with mansor a hero, and describes the origin of the world, of
life, and of human society. This description is not irrelevant
to the main purpose of the work; on the contrary, the exposition

would be incomplete, if it were not shown that the world and
its inhabitants came into being and continue to exist from
purely natural causes. ΤΙιο book falls into two main divisions
of nearly equal length, the first of which relates the creation of
the world, the second the history of man.

After a panegyric on Epicurus (1—54), the subjecte to be
treated of are enumerated. These are:

i. Τὴε mortal nature of the world.
ii. The formation oi the world.
iii. The kinds of animals which sprang from the earth
iv. The origin of speech.
v. The origin of religion.
vi. The movements of the heavenly bodies.

The first subiect is then begun, 91—1093 but here along
digression is inserted in which it is' proved that the world is not
divine, and that the gods had nothing to do with the making of
it Τὴο argument is resumed at 235 and ended at 41 ς. The
formation of the world is next described, 416-5633 but here

too there is a digression, 509-533‚ about the motion of the
stars. The rest of the first half of the book, 564-770, is taken

up by a very full discussion of the sun and moon, their size,
nimicus, and eclipses.

The second half begins with an account of the growth of
vegetation first and then ol animals and men, 770—836. lt is
next pointed out that in the struggle for existence many kinds
of animale became extinct3 but no such animals as a Centaur
or Scyllaeon at any time bave existed, 837-924.

The rest of the book describes the development of man in
civilisation, and may be divided as follows ι
