x INTRODUCTION.

obviously uniinished The last statement oi the chronicle‚ that
Cicero corrected the books, implies one fact which is certainly
true, that Lucretius leit his poem unfinished and that it was
given to the world after his death hy some other hand. But we
do not know what kind or amount os ‘correction' the editor
supplied, or even which Cicero was the editor, Marcus Tullius
or his brother Quintus. Lucretius is mentioned once by the
orator in a letter¹ written from Rome to his brother Quintus, in
January, 54 Β. c, four months after the poet's death; but
unfortunately the text os the passage is corrupt and throws no
light on either of these questions; it is impossible even to gather
how iar the writer admired the poem, and on what grounds.

These scanty and unsatisfactory details are all we are told
by the writers oi antiquity about the personal history of
Lucretius. He is mentioned occasionally by both poets and
prose-writers, sometimes quoted and sometimes criticised3 but
no particulare oi his life or death are anywhere else recorded.
lt is possible to add a very little to this meagre account from
the internal evidence oi his poem, though some of his editors
have pushed conjecture sar beyond reasonable limits.

ln the first place it is tolerably certain that he was a Roman

’ oi good family and fortune. His gentile name is that oi avery

old patrician house; and the terms of absolute equality in which
he addresses Memmius, a very distinguished figure at Rome in
those days, point to the same conclusion. A modern writer has
called Lucretius ‘the aristocrat with a mission’¹; and it is true
that the whole tone oi his poem is that oi a man in easy
circumstances and familiar with the luxury oi which he disap-
proves.

lt is still more certain that his lise was that ol a recluse.
Political activity was always distasteful to the Epicureans; and
at Rome just at this time civil war was impending, and the
political out-look was very dark. Lucretius is never more
inspired than when he is denouncing ambition. Nor again
could the immense literary activity ol the time bring him into
