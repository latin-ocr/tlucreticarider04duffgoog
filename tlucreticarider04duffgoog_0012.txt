’ vni PREFACE.

The text is in the main that of Munro's last edition ; but
I have admitted a few conjectures of Madvig and more
recent writers. All such deviatione from Munro's text are
indicated.

In writing the notes Ι have constantly consulted Munro's
commentary, and Ι have also kept before me the editions of
Professor Kelsey (Boston 1884) and os MM. Benoist and
Lantoine (Paris 1884), both os which are based on Munro
but contain some original matter. But, owing to the class ol
students whom Ι had in view, it was impossible for me to
follow any of these closely; and the notes are sor the most '
part os my own writing. FinallyI have to thank Dr J. P.
Postgate, Fellow of Trinity College, who most kindly
offered to read over the notes and made many suggestive
criticisms.
