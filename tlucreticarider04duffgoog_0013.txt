Tria chronicle of Hieronymus or St Jerome, compiled about
4oo'A.1>., has a record to the following effect: ‘the poet Titus

consequence of drinking a love-philtre and died by his own

statements made by St Jerome are even more doubtful than his
chronology. For first, with regard to the alleged madness and
