xxiv INTRODUCTION

from the body; it was bom together with it and will die with it.
Death therefore is nothing to us, as sensatiou cannot survive
for a moment the separation ol body and soul.

Lucretius brings lorward no less than twenty-seven agrimeuts
against the immortality of the soul. He is anxious to leave no

doubt on the point, as he believes that the unhappiness of men
is mainly due to their sear ol punishment iu a future life.

(3) Psncsrrmus nuo CONCEPTIONS. All knowledge,
according to Epicurus, depends on the senses. Their evidence
is unimpeachahle: when we get a wrong impression oi some

object we see, the blame rests, not with our sensation, but with ·

our judgment of the sensation, ie with the mind, not with the
eyes. By a repetition os the same perception there arises a
conception or notion (πρόληψις), which is called by Lucretius
notities, and more accurately by Cicero anticipatio. This notion
is a general picture, retained in the mind, of what has been
perceived. The origin oi perceptions is explained in the
following way. Exceedingly fine films (εἴδωλα, simulacra) are
constantly being discharged¹ from the suriace of'all bodies,
bearing the exact likeness ot the body itseli. These films move
with infinite speed through void and are conveyed to the soul
by the various organs of sense. When we see a horse, an
image has come from the horse and passed through our eyes
into the soul. Taste‚ hearing, and smell are explained in just
the same way; only the atoms os smells travel slower than the
atoms ol sounds‚ and the atoms of sounds slower than the
atoms of visible things. Thought also is excited entirely by
material ¹images; if we think of a Centaur, our thought is
duc to an image of a horse which has got mixed up with the
image of a man. Lucretius goes so lar as to say that when
we dream of dead friends, our dream is due to a material
image of them3 but it seems impossible to explain how any.
thing that no longer exists can discharge an image. Finally t0
images is ascribed the origin oi belief in the gods; but here t00
there is some inconsistency¹.
