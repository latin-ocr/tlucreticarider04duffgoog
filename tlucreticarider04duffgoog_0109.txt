NOTES. 73

521. Summanus was an obscure deity (que‘squis e's est, says Ovid)
who caused night-thunder ; hence Summania templa ate the nightly
sky; ior templa see n. to 1. 103.

522. aliunde nunnamenster ποθεν, ‘from some other place’3
i.e.‚ the air is not, like the beata, shut up in the stars themselves.

523· versat agenn, ‘drives and whirls’. Here again Lucr. seems
inconsistent in attributing volition to the stars3 we may account ior it
as we have already accounted lor such epithets as aeternus and uiuus
(ll. 402, 476).

5²4· euntes is nom. plur.

525. pascentese the food os the stars is fite. Comp. 1231 unde
aether sidera pascit? Seneca (Nat. Quaest. vii ai a) accounts thus lor
the motion oi a comet: ignium mado alimentum suum sequitur.

526. quid sit cuum, ‘which os these (explanations) holds²; an
indirect question alter ponere certum.

eertum, ‘for certain ’.

527. passit=potis sit. ‘is 'possible ’- omne, ed πᾶν, is the summa
summarum, the entire universe.

5²9· sequor disponere, ‘1 go on to distinguish' 3 a rare use ol
sequar=pergn

531. kec=hac remensum, our world.

532. vegeat: an active verb. signis: dat. commodi. eamn, sc.
causarum.

533. progrediente: the adjectival or attributive genitive; rash
assertionis not the attribute of one who etc.

534-563. ne eartle remains at rest in the middle of the world
because the weiglit of its lower parts is less than tleat (γ’ tlee upper.
Indeed its substance beneatle ic differentand mare akin to air. From
its lang connexion welle the air, the mult of tlee earth ic not felt
any mere than a man ftels tlee antrat of leis man limis. the air
nestains tlte eartle without effert just as tlee saul nestains the body.

535. pandus, sc. terrae.

5 36. convenitis impersonal.

naturam, ‘substance ¹, is object to habere, terram being supplied as
subject. This substance os which the earth is composed below must be
lighter than earth itseli in order to account lor the earth testing in the
middle oi the world. Apparently Lucr. conceived the earth to be a
more or less ilat surlace both above and below.
