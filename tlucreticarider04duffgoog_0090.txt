54 LUCRETIUS. BOOK V.

108. ratio, 'reasoning'; res, ‘the reality'.
109. succidere...vieta= translate by two coordinate verbs fragor

is defined by Seneca (Nat. Quaest. ii ry 3) as a sound subires et
vehemens.

κιο-134. sse editors point out that these linea interrupt the argu·
ment, which is to prove the precarious existence ol the world, and are
out oi place here. There are many auch passages, especially in the
last two books; they are rough drasts which Lucr. did not live long

enough to fit properly into his text. A nuurber oi the verses are copied
from his earlier books.

110-145. You must not think it profane to deny the dabinity and
permanente of tlte external world. The mind cannot exist outride

’ the body ,· indeed it can exist only in one special port of the body
itself. Tkerefore earth, stre, water, ond air cannot leave lise and
consequently ore not divine. ⁹

110. qua prius adgrediar quam de re=sed prius quam adgrediar
de hac re. fhta, ‘decrees ot* sate ’.

1¹4· ere-rearis: ne with the and pers. os the pres subj. makes a
final clause, not a prohibition, always iu Lucr. and generally in writers
ot' the best period; in Greek the same rule is invariable. But Horace
at least once (Sat. ii 3 88) and very early and late poets (eg. Plautus
and Martini) use nefarias as: ne feceris or noli secere.

116. corpore debinc: abl. oi description.

117. preter: subj. aster ne 1. 1¹4· Gigantum: they were punished
ior their impious attack ou heaven by being struck by thunderbolts or
imprisoned under mountains; Hor. Od. iii 4 73 iniecta monstro Terra
dolet suis.

¹19· disturbent moenia mundi, ‘displace the walls ol the world ’,
i.e. by saying it must perish. disturbent and velint below are subj.‚
because they are in dependent clauses oi oratio obliqua.

121. notantes, 'blaming’; used technically oi the censors.

roo. quoe refers back to l. 116, the last5 ll. being parenthetical‚
and includes the things enumerated in l. 1¹5· Tbe uss. have dr'stent
here and videri, not videntur, below3 this construction is so harsh that
l have admitted the conjecture of Madvig.

¹²3· The order is: et vzdmturindignaquae sint. With inrigua,
sc. easque adeo again.
¹²4· notitiam, ‘anotableinstance’. putentur=putari possint
