but, like other Latin poets, thought he had a right to make
what use he pleased of his Greek and Roman predecessors.
And he has merits ot' his own unsurpassed in the whole compass
ol Latin poetry. 1t has osten struck me that his genius is akin
to that os Milton. He displays a wonderful depth and fervour
of thought, expressed in language ol singular force and beauty3
an admirable faculty ol clear and vigorous and well-sustaincd
philosophical reasoning; and a style equal in its purity and
correctness to that of Terence, Caesar or Cicero, and superior
to that ol any writer of the Augustan age¹.’

When the poem of Lucretius was published, Virgil was
fifteen years of age. ‘At such an age therefore the style and
manner os Lucretius were able to impress themselves fully on
the younger poets susceptible mind; and perhaps the highest
eulogy which has ever been passed on the former is that con·
stant imitation of his language and thought which pervades
Virgil’s works from one end to the other ²! It may be added
that this influence was at its height at the time when the
Georgics, and especially the second, were written.

Virgil never mentions Lucretius directly3 but this is not
surprising when we rcmemher that he does not mention

⁴ Theocritus once in the Eclogues, nor Hesiod hy name in the

Georgics, nor Homer at all in the Aeneid. There is however
one passage which is unmistakably intended to carry an allusion
to Lucretius. The lines are as follows :

Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,
Atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum
Subiecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis avari.
