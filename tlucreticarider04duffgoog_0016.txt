xii JNTRODUCTJON

Days os Hesiod, the Georgics oi Virgil, the Essay on Man ol
Pope, all belong to this class of poetry. The subject which the
poem of Lucretius is intended to explain is the philosophical

system os Epicurus or part of it. A short account is given
below oi such Epicurean doctrines as are explained or alluded
to in the fifth book of Lucretius.

The form and title ol the poem are derived from Empedocles
oi Agrigentum, who lived in the fifth century nc. and wrote a
famous treatise in hexameter verse, ίπερὶ pieros? os which
some fragments are extant The poem is dedicated to Gaius
Memmius, prominent as an orator and statesman of the sena·
torial party, but a worthless and unprincipled man; why
Lucretius thought him worthy ol this distinction, we cannot
tell. No other contemporary is mentioned in the poem, though
some editors have thought they could trace allusione to Clodius
and to Caesar.

The first two books are devoted to a very full account of
atoms and void, these being, according to Democritus and
Epicurus, the two great factors ol the universe; here too the
rival systems os other philosophers are stated and reluted
There is less evidence of incompleteness in these books than in
the others. The third book is mainly taken up in proving that
the soul is a material part of man, made up of atoms as the
body is, and dying with the body. This theory is of the highest
importance in the eyes of Lucretius and is therefore proved at
great length. The fourth book explains the Epicurean theory
ol sight and the other senses; the fifth gives an account of the
origin of the world, os lise, and oi human society3 oi this book
a fuller analysis is given below. · Τὴο last book is miscellaneous
in its contents. It begins bydiscussing the nature os thunder
and lightning and other celestial phenomena; it then deals with
various natural curiosities, such as magnetic attraction, and
ends with a description, taken from Thucydides, of the plague
os Athens. It is obviously more confused and less complete
than any of the other books.

Thus it will be seen that Lucretius begins by laying down
the first principles of the atomic philosophy, and then discusses
