ssus Lucretius discusses all the subjecte he had promised
to discuss‚ and others as well; but not in their original order.
So the account of the sun and moon, instead of coming last, is
given immediately after the account os the world's formation.
lt is also clear that certain paragraphs did not form part os the
original sketch but were added subsequently. Thus at 1091
the first discovery os fire is related, but, at ror-r, it was already

in general use. These inconsistent paragraphs are indicated in
the notes, as they occur.
