tn sine, shape, and weight, and are unlimited in number. They
hau'e existed from everlasting and can never be split up or
destroyed in any way, because they are solid and indivisible,

containing no void. They are in constant motion, being
impelled downwards by their own weight and sideways by the
blows of other atoms ; they are so small that our sight cannot
perceive them. Void also is unlimited in extent; and so the
universe, which is made up of these two constituente, is also
unlimited. · A finite world such as oure, including earth, sea,
and sky, is formed whenever a concourse of atoms, after many
fruitless experiments, have assumed positions which enable
them to move fora time without separating from one another.
Buta world so formed, as it had a beginning, will also have
an end; and the liberated atoms will then continue their race
through void and take part in future combinations. All these
operations are the result of chance, not of design.

It was certainly a happy intuition that induced Epicurus,
indifferent as he was to science in general, to adopt this scien-
tific theory. His contemporaries thought it ridiculous, but
modern science has accepted itas true in the main. ‘The
propositions in which Lucretius has stated his atomio theory
anticipate some recent discoveries in both chemistry and physics
in a most marvellous way. Science has now proved that his
propositions as to the constitution of matter are either certainly
true, or else foreshadow the truth1.’

(a) THE Sottt.. The psychology of Epicurus is stn'ctly
materialistic, and admits no difference between mind and
matter. Just as the body is made up of atoms, so is the soul
or vital principle (ψυχή, anima), and the mind or rational
principle (λόγος, animus). The only difference is that the soul
and mind consist of the smallest and lightest atoms; this is
proved by the speed of thought and hythe fact that the body,
when life has ceased, is not diminished in siae and weight.
The vital principle is diffused over the whole body; the rational

principle has its seat in the breast The seul, under which
both anima and ammas may be included, cannot exist apart
