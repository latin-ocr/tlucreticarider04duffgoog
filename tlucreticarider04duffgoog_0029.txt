INTRODUCTION. xxv
(4) TflEGODs. Epicurus taught that the gods are immortal

- and perfectly happy. But this happiness would be perturbed ii

they sympatbised with the sorrows ol men. Therefore he held
that they were absolutely regardless of human aiiairs and
indifferent to our merits or demerits. Their body consists of
atoms so fine as to be invisible· to our senses; they live in
spaces between worlds (μετακόσμια, intermundiis), where no
stonns ever come. lt is certain from the evil in the world
that the gods had no hand in making it

This theory is beset with difficulties, which might perhaps

have been removed if Lucretius had iulfilled his intention os .

explaining it at largel. But in fact the gods are quite out oi
place in the system of Epicurus. Tbeir place is occupied by
Nature, which is conceived, at all events by Lucretius, as au
omnipotent and omnipresent force, governing the universe by
fixed laws. Ii the Epicurean gods are included in the universe
and are formed of atoma as we are told, how can they escape
the general law that all combinations of atoms had a beginning
and must bave an end? To give a satisfactory answer, Epicurus
must have sacrificed the unityos his system.

(5) Tria Haavnwrr Romus. His theory of knowledge led
Epicurus to strange conclusions in his astronomy. Everything,
he said, which can be testedby the senses and is confirmed by
them, is true; again, opinions which cannot be brought to this
test and at the same time are not contradicted by it, are all
equally true. Thus it is a certain truth that the sun is really
about the same size as' it appears to us to be, because a fire
on earth, so long as it is visible, does not diminish in size².
But to say that the stars and the sun must move from some
one controlling cause, or that eclipses admit of only one expla-
nation, is a vain unphilosophical assumption. For these things
are beyond our powers oi observatiou, and there are many
ways of explaining them, none oi which is contradicted by the
evidence ol the semes, and each of which must be true, ii not
sor our world, for some one oi the countless worlds contained in

heuniverse. ·
