xxviii INTRODUCTION.

with the equator EQWR, exactly hali oi which is above the
horizon, so that the lengths ol day 3ηά night are equal ln the
figure the node or point os intersection is sor convenience repre·
sented as just setting at W; the ecliptic is shown in the position
which it would occupy at 6p.m. on March 21st. The sun
crosses the equator again from North to South at the time ol
the autumnal equinox, in the sign of the Scales; rising at E
at 6 ann. on Sept. 23rd.

The Solstices are the points C and L of the sun's annual
path at which he is furthest from the equator. The sun is at
C and due south at noon on June zand, On that day his daily
course is the circle CG, the greater half of which is above the
horizon, so that the day is longer than the night. The sun is at
Lat midnight on Dec. ²tst; the greater half of his daily course
LK, is then below the horizon (see ll 682-686). ι

These points are called Solsticcs because the sun, aster
moving away from the equatur, appears to stop and turn back.
They are also called Tropics, ie. turning points. The summer
solstice C isin the sign of Cancer (the Crab), the winter solstice
Lin that oi Capricorn (the Goat); see ll. ὄις-617.

Eclipses. The moon completos the circuit ol the Zodiac once
a month. Her orbit is slightly inclined to the ecliptic; it it co·
incided with the ecliptic, it is evident that the moon would pass
between the earth and the sun every month, causing an eclipse.
As it is, eclipses can only occur when the moon happens to be
near one 'os the nodas oi her orbit, ie. those points where her orbit
intersects the ecliptic An eclipse ot the sun can only occur at
new moon, when the moon is between the sun and the earth; an
eclipseos the moon, at fult moon, when the moon is on the side
os the earth opposite to the sun, 3ηά passas through the cone os
the earth's shadow (see t 764).
