imagine himself at the centre Ο os the sphere. lu the accom-
panying figure, which represents the celestial sphere as seen in
latitude 60⁰ N.‚ the places os the stars are not shown, but only
some imaginary circles to which their positione are referred

The observer’s Horr‘ron is represented by the circle N ESW.
The hali, N LP'S, below the horizon, is oi course invisible to the
observer.

The Arri, POP‘, is the direction oi the earth's axis oi rotation‚
round which, iu consequence of the earrh’s rotation, the starry
sphere appearsto turn. The ancieuts believed that the earth
was really at rest in the centre ol the universe and that the stars
were fixed to an invisible frama-work which revolved round the
earth. ⁴

The Pales P, P', arethe points in which the axis meets the
sphere ; they are called the North and South Poles respectively.

Tbe Equator EQWR is an imaginary circle midway between
the poles. lt meets the horizon in the East and West points, E
and W.

The suu has two apparent motione, which are both really

due to motions ol the eartn The rotation os the earth on its
axis makes him appear to rise and set every day; while the
revolution os the earth in its orbit round the sun makes him
appear to travel round the slry once a year.

The Echinia, ECWL, is the apparent annual path os the sun
among the stare. The celestial sphere appears to turn from
East to West3 but tbe sun, in his annual path, appears to
travel in the contrary direction.

The Zodiac, so named from the animals (ζῴδια) by which the
constellatione are represented, is a narrow belt of sky on either
side os the ecliptic lt is divided into twelve equal portious
called the Sigus qs tlu lodice, which are named alter the con·
stellations they contain.

The Nodes or Equinoxes arethe points in which the ecliptic
cute the equator. The sun in his course along the ecliptic from
West to East crosses the equator from South to North at the
time os the vernal equinox (March arst) in the sign of the Ram
(scel. 687). His daily course in the sky then coincides exactly
