INTRODUCTION. xiii

in his last four books some special applications of that doctrine,
which formed part of the system of Epicurus. The aim of the
poet throughout is not so much purely scientific as practica! and
moral His main object, as he tells us again and again, is to
free men's minds from the yoke of superstitious fears by dis-

playing to them the aspect and the laws ol nature3 and this is
why he argues with such passionate eamestness against the
immortality of the soul and the interierence os the gods in
human affairs. Thus the purpose of the fifth book is to show
that the world and all that it contains were not created by
divine power, and that all progress is the result of natural
experience, not os divine guidance. And on the whole it
appears that Lucretius lived long enough to complete in out·
line tho whole task he had set before himself, though the latter
partos the poem is sar from complete in artistic finish and
arrangement of materials.

With regard to the diction and metre os the poem, Lucretius
‘deliberately adopted a style which must have seemed archaic to
his contemporaries. This may be seen by comparing the De
Rerum Natura with the Peleus and Thetis os Catullus, which
was certainly written at nearly the same time. Just as Greek
epic verse continued to the end to imitate the forms and
vocabulary ol Homer, so Lucretius thought fit to take sor his
model the Annales of Ennius, the only great epic which 'the
language possessed, though two centuries had passed since it
was written. At the beginning of his own poem he makes
honourable mention of Ennius1, and constantly imitates even the
few hundred lines os fragments which we possess lt is pro·
bable too that his archaism was intended as a protest against
the tendency os contemporary Latin literature For just at this
time there was great literary activity among the Romans.
Any educated man could, as Mommsen says, turn off his five
hundred hexameters at a sitting; Quintus Cicero wrote four
tragedies in a fortnight to begnile the dulness ol winter-quarters
in Gaul But all these poems were worthless imitations of bad
models,—ol Callimachus and the other learned poets of Alex·
